# Sliding Window – Easy, Medium & Hard (DSA)

This repository contains **Sliding Window based Data Structures and Algorithms problems** implemented in **C++**.

All programs are stored in a single folder, but they are **logically categorized by Sliding Window patterns and difficulty levels** to help with **structured learning and interview preparation**.

---

## 🪟 Sliding Window – Patterns Overview

Sliding Window is an optimization technique used to reduce time complexity from **O(n²)** to **O(n)** by maintaining a window using two pointers.

Patterns covered:
- Constant (Fixed Size) Window
- Longest Subarray / Substring
- Counting Subarrays / Substrings
- Shortest / Minimum Window

## 🟢 Easy Problems

(Constant window and basic variable window problems)
1.MaxSumConstantWindowk.cpp  
2.LongestSubarrayCondition.cpp  
3.MaxScoreFromCards.cpp  
4.LenOfLongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingChar.cpp  
5.MaxConsecutiveOnesIII.cpp  
6.MaxFruitInBasket.cpp  

## 🟡 Medium Problems

(Variable window with conditions and counting logic)

9.CountLongestRepeatingCharReplacement.cpp 
10.CountSubstringContainKChars.cpp  
11.BinarySubarraySumK.cpp  
12.CountNiceSubarrays.cpp  

## 🔴 Hard Problems

## 📌 Notes

- All programs are written in **C++**
- Difficulty levels are mentioned **only in this README**
- Focuses on **patterns rather than brute-force solutions**
- Covers **commonly asked Sliding Window interview questions**
- Mastering **Minimum Window Substring** means mastering Sliding Window
